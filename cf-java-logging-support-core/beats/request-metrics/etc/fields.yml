summary: |
  This is a specification of the "request metrics beat" message type that captures
  all relevant information for both incoming and outgoing requests that are
  shipped among and processed by "components" (i.e. applications or services)
  running in a Cloud Foundry (CF) landscape.

  While most of the time we're dealing with HTTP requests, we want to keep
  the terminology as much as possible "protocol-neutral". Actually, we also
  think about capturing "call stacks" within a component's runtime using that
  scheme.

  Field names follow the convention that we're not using camel case names, but
  rather use "_" as a delimiter between parts.

  For any field that actually represents a measure (or metric for that matter)
  the name includes a descriptive suffix mnemonic that helps identifying the unit,
  e.g.:

    * "_ms" -> milliseconds
    * "_b"  -> bytes
    * "_p"  -> percent
    * "_at" -> date with time
    * "_ts" -> a timestamp value

ctx:
  type: group
  description: |
    This group contains context information for the given request such that
    analytics can slice and dice information based on these criteria.
    It should also help establish correlations between multiple request that
    form something "bigger", often termed "(business) transaction".

    NOTE: Context information is most likely provided by CF itself, e.g. in
    the form of environment variables (or request headers).

  fields:
    - name: "written_at"
      type: date
      required: true
      description: |
        The human-readable date when the message was written.

    - name: "written_ts"
      type: long
      required: true
      example: 1456820553816849408
      description: |
        The timestamp in nano-second precision when the message was written.

    - name: "correlation_id"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "db2d002e-2702-41ec-66f5-c002a80a3d3f"
      description: |
        A unique identifier that can be used to correlate multiple messages into a logical unit.
        
        Currently, we use a UUID for that matter, but future versions may use
        a different key for this.

        "-" indicates that no proper value could be provided.

        NOTE: As these type of messages can be written at any time and outside
        a "request context" it may happen that this correlation id does not
        match with any other. Logging implementations may provide a way to
        inherit correlation ids from request processing layers further up in
        the processing stack. If so, that id should be used.

    - name: "request_id"
      string: string
      required: false
      example: "e24a5963-95eb-4568-b1ae-81b67c41e99a"

      description: |
        A unique identifier of the software component that has written the message. 
        It may either be a "service" or an "application" that can be deployed to
        a container or VM, but it may not yet fully identify the actual "running instance" of
        that "component".

        NOTE: For applications in CF, this is the "application_id", but we may have more than one
        instance of that running.

      type: string
      required: false

      type: string
      required: true
      example: "application"
      description: |

        Either "application" or "service"

        CF allows us to scale out horizontally by running several instances of the
        same "component" in one container, this is identifying the instance.
        Defaults to "0".

      format: ???
      example: "???"
      description: |
        The unique identifier of the container on which the software component instance is running.

        NOTE: If security/privacy is not an issue, an IP address would be ok.

        NOTE: CF sets an environment variable "INSTANCE_IP" that is currently used
        for that purpose

    - name: "organization_id"
      type: string

    - name: "layer"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "[CF/RTR]"
      description: |
        The layer in the overall setup that emitted the request metrics message. E.g.,
        we often have "router" components which are placed in front of an application
        and which report request information they have forwarded to that
        application instance. From a logical point of view, they can be considered
        part of the overall application.

    - name: "type"
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |
        The type of the message.
        To make the message self-contained this is the type tag.
        As we're talking about request metrics messages, it's always "request".

request-metrics:
  type: group
  description: |
    Reports metrics on a request that has been shipped/processed.

    We assume that we have a "client"/"server" or "consumer"/"producer" relationship,
    i.e. the client/consumer will send a request to a server/producer which will
    process that request and will send a response back to that client/consumer.

    Processing such a request may trigger additional outgoing requests where
    the original server/producer change roles and turns into a client/consumer.

    When it comes to request timings, we foresee something similar to what
    Finagle is doing, i.e. conceptually keep track of 4 timestamps in order
    to be able to detect (network) latencies.

  fields:
    - name: "request"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "/get/api/v2"

        For HTTP requests, it is the request path.

        "-" indicates that no proper value could be provided which is hopefully
        never the case.

        NOTE: Not available for incoming request at producer end unless
        shipped with the request (in the form of a header or meta data).

        NOTE: Not available for outcoming request at consumer end unless
        shipped with the response (in the form of a header or meta data).

        NOTE: Still open whether this is the point in time when the first byte
        of the request has been received by the producer or when the complete
        request has been received (preferred).

      description: |
        The time in milli-seconds it has taken the processing component to compute the response.

        NOTE: If a consumer is reporting that for an outgoing requests, it's
        rather the time it took the consumer to wait until the (complete)
        response arrived.

        -1 indicates that the value could not be measured/determined

    - name: "protocol"
      type: string

        this will be HTTP (including a version specifier), but for outgoing
        requests reported by a producer it may contain other values. E.g. a
        database call via JDBC may report, e.g. "JDBC/1.2"

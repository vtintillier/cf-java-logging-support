summary: |
  This is a specification of the "request metrics beat" message type that captures
  all relevant information for both incoming and outgoing requests that are
  shipped among and processed by "components" (i.e. applications or services)
  running in a Cloud Foundry (CF) landscape.

  While most of the time we're dealing with HTTP requests, we want to keep
  the terminology as much as possible "protocol-neutral". Actually, we also
  think about capturing "call stacks" within a component's runtime using that
  scheme.

  Field names follow the convention that we're not using camel case names, but
  rather use "_" as a delimiter between parts.

  For any field that actually represents a measure (or metric for that matter)
  the name includes a descriptive suffix mnemonic that helps identifying the unit,
  e.g.:

    * "_ms" -> milliseconds
    * "_b"  -> bytes
    * "_p"  -> percent
    * "_at" -> date with time
    * "_ts" -> a timestamp value

ctx:
  type: group
  description: |
    This group contains context information for the given request such that
    analytics can slice and dice information based on these criteria.
    It should also help establish correlations between multiple request that
    form something "bigger", often termed "(business) transaction".

    NOTE: Context information is most likely provided by CF itself, e.g. in
    the form of environment variables (or request headers).

  fields:
    - name: "written_at"
      type: date
      required: true
      format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.milliZ

      description: |
        Should provide a unique identifier that can be used to correlate multiple
        requests into a larger logical unit (aka "business transaction").

        "-" indicates that no proper value could be provided.

    - name: "request_id"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "59d76883-8cdc-434b-73c4-1825313cd918"
      description: |
        Unique identifier for a request instance.

        NOTE: As request processing most likely happens at various "layers"
        (see below), chances are high that there is more than one message that
        is tagged with this id.

        "-" indicates that no proper value could be provided.

    - name: "component_id"
      type: string
      required: true

      description: |
        Uniquely identifies the software component that has processed the current
        request. It may either be a "service" or an "application" that can be deployed to
        a container or VM, but it may not yet fully identify the actual "running instance" of
        that "component".

        NOTE: For applications in CF, this is the "application_id", but we may have more than one
        instance of that running.

      type: string
      required: false
      example: "my-fancy-component"

    - name: "component_instance"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "7"
      description: |
        CF allows us to scale out horizontally by running several instances of the
        same "component" (see above) in one container, this is identifying the instance.
        Defaults to "0".

    - name: "container_id"

      example: "???"
      description: |
        Will allow us to identify the "box" or "container" onto which the component
        instance(s) were deployed.

        NOTE: If security/privacy is not an issue, an IP address would be ok.

        NOTE: CF sets an environment variable "INSTANCE_IP" that is currently used
        for that purpose

    - name: "organization_id"

      required: true
      example: "[CF/RTR]"
      description: |
        The layer in the overall setup that emitted the request metrics message. E.g.,
        we often have "router" components which are placed in front of an application
        and which report request information they have forwarded to that
        application instance. From a logical point of view, they can be considered
        part of the overall application.

    - name: "type"
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |
        To make the message self-contained this is the type tag.
        As we're talking about request metrics messages, it's always "request-metrics".

request-metrics:
  type: group
  description: |
    Reports metrics on a request that has been shipped/processed.

    We assume that we have a "client"/"server" or "consumer"/"producer" relationship,
    i.e. the client/consumer will send a request to a server/producer which will
    process that request and will send a response back to that client/consumer.

    Processing such a request may trigger additional outgoing requests where
    the original server/producer change roles and turns into a client/consumer.

    When it comes to request timings, we foresee something similar to what
    Finagle is doing, i.e. conceptually keep track of 4 timestamps in order
    to be able to detect (network) latencies.

  fields:
    - name: "request"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "/get/api/v2"
      description: |
        The actual request "command" that has been processed.

        "-" indicates that no proper value could be provided which is hopefully
        never the case.

        The precision is in milliseconds. The timezone is UTC.

        NOTE: Not available for incoming request at producer end unless
        shipped with the request (in the form of a header or meta data).

        shipped with the response (in the form of a header or meta data).

        NOTE: Still open whether this is the point in time when the first byte
        of the request has been received by the producer or when the complete
        request has been received (preferred).

      required: true
      example: "IN"

      description: |
        How many milliseconds it took the producer to prepare the response.

        NOTE: If a consumer is reporting that for an outgoing requests, it's
        rather the time it took the consumer to wait until the (complete)
        response arrived.

        -1 indicates that the value could not be measured/determined

    - name: "protocol"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "HTTP/1.1"
      description: |
        Which protocol was used to issue a request to a producer. In most cases,
        this will be HTTP (including a version specifier), but for outgoing
        requests reported by a producer it may contain other values. E.g. a
        database call via JDBC may report, e.g. "JDBC/1.2"
